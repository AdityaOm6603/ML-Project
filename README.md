### ML-Project

This repository contains an analysis of housing prices using Ridge Regression. The objective is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on various housing characteristics. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of the model's performance and coefficients.

Key features:
Data preprocessing and outlier detection
Feature scaling and normalization
Model training and evaluation using Ridge Regression
Visualization and interpretation of model coefficients

Performance metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.47
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 27.18
R-squared: 0.63
Adjusted R-squared: 0.56
